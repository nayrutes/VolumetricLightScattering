    text: This template is a good starting point for people focused on high-end graphics
      that want to develop games for platforms that support Shader Model 5.0 (DX11
      and above). This template utilizes the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP),
      a modern rendering pipeline that includes advanced material types and a configurable
      hybrid tile/cluster deferred/forward lighting architecture. This template also includes the Shader Graph tool, Visual Effect graph tool, several Presets to jump start development, and example content.
